Chapter 1: The CANOE Builder

Dick stood on a coral ledge, gazing south. Behind him, the ocean roared, its spray whipped by the wind. Before him stretched the lagoon of Karolin—a vast expanse of calm, blue water dotted with fishing gulls. This forty-mile-wide, coral-ringed lagoon was his, though he'd arrived only yesterday.

The beach bustled: women, children, and youths fished, played, or worked on their patches.  They were his people now. The canoes on the sand, the empty houses that once held war canoes—all were his.

His gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowing. He turned to face the northern sea's crashing waves. Beyond the horizon, invisible yet menacing, lay Palm Tree Island—a paradise in his dreams, a devil's lair in reality.

Nearby, young Tari, son of net-maker Le Taioi, looked up. Tari knew little of life, but he knew war had left Karolin's women and children vulnerable and leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat from the north had arrived, carrying this man and Katafa, a girl lost at sea years before. The women believed he was a god-sent chief.

Tari, innocent of adult complexities, simply asked, "Taori, who are you?"

Dick could hardly answer. How could he explain?  He might have said: "Tari, I'm from a world unknown to you. My name is Dick Lestrange. Shipwrecked as a child on Palm Tree with an old sailor, Kearney, he taught me to fish and build toy ships unlike your canoes. Then Katafa arrived, the lost girl. After Kearney died, we escaped men who came to cut down the island's trees, and sailed here."

But he couldn't. The name "Dick," and his childhood language, were fading. Kearney was a distant memory, swallowed by the island's intense sun, storms, and rain. Only the toy ships remained.

He looked at the child. "I am Taori, Tari. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Tari replied. "I just ask. But grown-ups never answer… Look, fish!" His attention shifted to children hauling in a net, and he ran off.

Dick's gaze returned north. The child's question stirred memories: the burned schooner, his escape with Katafa in Kearney's dinghy, their arrival, and the people who saw him as a god-sent leader.

But the memory also brought the threat of the men he'd left behind. They lacked canoes now, but would build them. They'd see the lagoon's reflection in the sky and come. It might take time, but they would.

Dick was a native, yet a white man remained within. He could plan, strategize, and imagine. That's why he'd summoned Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—skilled, elderly canoe-builders—and why the sight of so many young men nearing fighting age filled him with purpose.  Underlying everything was his love for Katafa, threatened by the looming danger.

War canoes: would he defend the lagoon or launch a preemptive strike?  It was unclear.

A hand touched his shoulder. Katafa stood beside him, a stray lock of dark hair blowing in the wind.  Her eyes were fixed north, where a hazy shape was emerging.

"Look," she whispered.

Palm Tree, usually hidden, was visible through a mirage. They had seen it last night, and now it reappeared—a faint smudge, then a clearer image, beautiful yet menacing.

They stood silently, remembering their escape, the savage men, the burning ship, the terror of their flight. The island's beauty masked the evil within.

Dick's nostrils flared, his eyes darkening with hatred. They had threatened him, but more importantly, Katafa. And they still did.

They would come. The vision of Palm Tree confirmed his instincts. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's reflection, and come. They lacked women; Karolin had plenty. The same instinct that drew him to Katafa would draw them to Karolin's women.

He knew danger wasn't only in the north. It lurked wherever greed and hatred resided, among savages and civilized "wolves" alike.

To Dick, the world was the water surrounding the two islands. Yet, even in his short life, he'd learned to fear men, to understand the primal urge for war and destruction.

The mirage of Palm Tree faded, vanishing as quickly as it appeared. Katafa pointed across the lagoon. A canoe approached from the south—the one Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, they walked towards the beach to meet it.
