{"original": "\"The Gates of Morning\"\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE CANOE BUILDER\n\nDICK standing on a ledge of coral cast his eyes to the South.\n\nBehind him the breakers of the outer sea thundered and the spindrift scattered on the wind; before him stretched an ocean calm as a lake, infinite, blue, and flown about by the fishing gulls\u2014the lagoon of Karolin.\n\nClipped by its forty-mile ring of coral this great pond was a sea in itself, a sea of storm in heavy winds, a lake of azure, in light airs\u2014and it was his\u2014he who had landed here only yesterday.\n\nWomen, children, youths, all the tribe to be seen busy along the beach in the blazing sun, fishing with nets, playing their games or working on the paraka patches, all were his people. His were the canoes drawn up on the sand and his the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.\n\nThen as he cast his eyes from the lagoon to the canoe houses his brow contracted, and, turning his back to the lagoon he stood facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Away there,\u200bbeyond  the sea line, invisible, lay Palm Tree, an island beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.\n\nLittle Tari the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sitting on the coral close by, looked up at him. Tari knew little of life, but he knew that all the men of Karolin swept away by war had left the women and the boys and the children like himself defenceless and without a man or leader.\n\nThen, yesterday, from the northern sea in a strange boat and with Katafa, the girl who had been blown to sea years ago when out fishing, this strange new figure had come, sent by the gods, so the women said, to be their chief and ruler.\n\nThe child knew nothing of whom the gods might be nor did he care, alone now with this wonderful new person, and out of earshot of his mother, he put the question direct with all the simplicity of childhood.\n\n\u201cTaori,\u201d said little Tari, \u201cwho are you?\u201d (\u00e9 kamina tai)\n\nCould Dick have answered, would the child have understood the strange words of the strange story Dick might have told him? \u201cTari, I come of people beyond the world you know. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was smaller than you, Tari, I was left alone with an old sailor man on that island you call Marua (Palm Tree), which lies beyond sight fifty miles to the north. There we lived and there I grew to be a boy and Kearney, that was his name, taught me to fish and spear fish, and he made for me things to play with, little ships unlike the canoes of\u200bthe islands. And then, Tari, one day long ago came Katafa, the girl who was blown away from here in a storm. She lived with us till Kearney died and then we two were alone. She taught me her language, which is the language of Karolin. She named me Taori; we loved one another and might have lived for ever at Marua had not a great ship come there filled with bad men, men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came to cut the trees. Then they rose and killed the white men with them and burned the ship and in our boat we escaped from them, taking with us everything we loved, even the little ships, and steering for Karolin, we came, led by the lagoon light in the sky.\"\n\nBut he could not tell Tari this, or at least all of it, for the very name of Dick had passed from his memory, that and the language he had spoken as a child; Kearney, the sailor who had brought him up, was all but forgotten, all but lost sight of in the luminous haze that was his past.\n\nThe past, for men long shipwrecked and alone, becomes blurred and fogged, for Dick it began only with the coming of Katafa to Marua, behind and beyond that all was forgotten as though consumed in the great blaze of tropic light that bathed the island and the sea, the storms that swept the coconut groves, the mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been quite forgotten but for the little ships he had made as playthings for the boy\u2014who was now a man.\n\n\u200bHe looked down at the questioning child. \u201cI am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d said the child. \u201cI ask as I breathe but no big folk\u2014madyana\u2014will ever answer the questions of Tari\u2014 Ai, the fish!\u201d His facile mind had already dropped the subject, attracted by the cries of some children, hauling in a net, and he rose and trotted away.\n\nDick turned his gaze again to the north. The question of the child had stirred his mind and he saw again the schooner that had put in to Palm Tree only to be burned by the Melanesian hands, he saw again Katafa and himself as they made their escape in the old dinghy that Kearney had taught him to handle as a boy. He saw their landing on this beach, yesterday, and the women and children swarming round him, he the man whom they considered sent by the gods to be their chief and leader.\n\nThen as he gazed towards the north the memory of the men from whom he had escaped with the girl stained the beauty of sea and sky.\n\nThere was no immediate fear of the men who had taken possession of Palm Tree; the men of Palm Tree had no canoes, but they would build canoes\u2014surely they would build canoes, and as surely they would see the far mirror blaze of Karolin lagoon in the sky, just as he had seen it, and they would come. It might be a very long time yet, but they would come.\n\nDick was an all but blook, a kanaka, a savage,\u200band yet the white man was there. He could think forward, he could think round a subject and he could imagine.\n\nThat was why he had sent a canoe that morning across to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia and Tafata, three old men, too old for war, but expert canoe-builders, that was why when gazing at the tribe in full congregation, his eyes had brightened to the fact that nearly a hundred of the youths were ripening to war age, but under all, lighting and animating his mind, raising daring to eagle heights, lay his passion for Katafa, his other self more dear to him than self, threatened, ever so vaguely, yet still threatened.\n\nWar canoes! Did he intend fighting any invaders in the lagoon or as they drew towards shore, or did he vaguely intend to be the attacker, destroying the danger at its source before it could develop? Who knows?\n\nA hand fell upon his shoulder and turning, he found himself face to face with Katafa, a lock of her dark hair escaped from the thread of elastic vine that bound it, blew right back on the breeze like an eagle\u2019s feather, and her eyes, luminous and dark instead of meeting his, were fixed towards the point where he had been gazing\u2014the due-north sea line.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d said Katafa.\n\nAt big intervals and in certain conditions of weather Palm Tree, though far behind the sea line,\u200bbecame visible from Karolin through mirage. Last evening they had seen it and now again it was beginning to live, to bloom, to come to life, a mysterious stain low down in the southern sky, a dull spot in the sea dazzle, that deepened by degrees and hardened till as if sketched in by some unseen painter, the island showed beautiful as a dream, diaphanous, yet vivid.\n\nWith her hand upon his shoulder they stood without speaking, their minds untutored, knowing nothing of mirage, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped and which was rising now so strangely beyond the far sea line as if to gaze at them.\n\nThey saw again the horde of savages on the beach, figures monstrous as the forms in a nightmare, they felt again the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety and the open sea, and again they heard the yells of the Melanesians mad with rum stolen from the schooner they had brought in, and which they had burnt. And there, there before them lay the scene of the Tragedy, that lovely picture which showed nothing of the demons that still in habited it.\n\nThen as Dick gazed on this loveliness, which was yet a threat and a warning, his nostrils expanded and his eyes grew dark with hate. They had threatened him\u2014that was nothing, they had threatened Katafa, that was everything\u2014and they still threatened her.\n\nSome day they would come. The vision of Palm\u200bTree seemed to repeat what instinct told him. They would build canoes and seeing the lagoon mirror-light in the sky, they would come. They had no women, those men, and here were women, and instinct half whispered to him that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon in search of some island whose tribe might be raided of its women and seeing the lagoon light they would come.\n\nAh, if he had known, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed or desire or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not only amongst savages, but the wolves of civilization.\n\nTo Dick there was no world beyond the world of water that ringed the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life as the life of Katafa, and yet even in that life, short as it was, he had learned to dread men and he had envisaged the foundation of all history\u2014man\u2019s instinct for war, rapine and destruction.\n\nThen gradually the vision of Palm Tree began to fade and pass, suddenly it vanished like a light blown out and as they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the lagoon water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Dick has sent for the canoe builders and, leaving the coral, they came down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.\n\nLayout 2", "spun": "## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder\n\nDick stood on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon.  Behind him, the ocean roared, its spray whipped by the wind.  Before him lay the lagoon of Karolin \u2013 a vast expanse of calm, blue water, dotted with fishing gulls.  This forty-mile-wide, coral-ringed lagoon was his, a place he\u2019d only arrived at yesterday.\n\nThe beach bustled with activity: women, children, and young people fished, played games, or worked on their patches.  They were all his people now. The canoes pulled up on the sand, the empty houses that once held war canoes \u2013 all were his.\n\nHis eyes shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowing. He turned to face the crashing waves of the northern sea.  Beyond the horizon, invisible but ever-present, lay Palm Tree Island \u2013 a paradise in his mind, but a devil's lair in reality.\n\nNearby, young Tari, son of the net-maker Le Taioi, looked up. Tari didn't know much about life, but he knew that war had left Karolin's women and children vulnerable, leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, carrying this new man and Katafa, a girl lost at sea years ago. The women believed this man was sent by the gods to be their chief.\n\nTari, unburdened by adult concerns, simply asked, \"Taori, who are you?\"\n\nDick couldn't easily answer. Could he explain his past?  \"Tari,\" he might have said, \"I'm from a world you don't know. My name is Dick Lestrange.  I was shipwrecked as a child on that island you call Palm Tree, with an old sailor named Kearney. He taught me to fish and build toy ships, totally different from your canoes.  Then Katafa came, the girl lost at sea. After Kearney died, we escaped from bad men who came to cut down the island's trees, and we sailed here.\"\n\nBut he couldn't.  The name \"Dick\" was fading, along with the language of his childhood.  Kearney was a distant memory, swallowed by the intense sun, storms, and rain of his past. Only the toy ships remained as a reminder.\n\nHe looked at the curious child. \"I am Taori, Tari. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tari replied. \"I just ask. But grown-ups never answer my questions\u2026 Look, fish!\"  His attention shifted to children hauling in a net, and he ran off.\n\nDick's gaze returned to the north. The child's question stirred memories: the burned schooner, his escape with Katafa in Kearney's old dinghy, their arrival on this beach, the people who saw him as a god-sent leader.\n\nBut the memory of his escape also brought the threat of the men he'd left behind.  They had no canoes now, but they would build them. They'd see the lagoon's reflection in the sky and come.  It might take time, but they would come.\n\nDick was a native, yet a white man lingered within. He could plan, strategize, and imagine.  That's why he'd sent for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata \u2013 old men, skilled canoe-builders \u2013 and why the sight of so many young men nearing fighting age filled him with a sense of purpose.  Underlying everything was his love for Katafa, a love threatened by the looming danger.\n\nWar canoes: would he defend the lagoon, or launch a preemptive strike? It remained unclear.\n\nA hand touched his shoulder. Katafa stood beside him, a stray lock of her dark hair blowing in the wind. Her eyes were fixed on the north, where a hazy shape was beginning to appear.\n\n\"Look,\" she whispered.\n\nPalm Tree, usually hidden beyond the horizon, was visible through a mirage.  Last night they'd seen it, and now it reappeared \u2013 a faint smudge, then a clearer image, beautiful yet menacing.\n\nThey stood silently, their minds filled with the memory of their escape, the savage men, the burning ship, the terror of their flight. The island's beauty masked the evil that still dwelled there.\n\nDick's nostrils flared, his eyes darkening with hatred. They had threatened him, but more importantly, they had threatened Katafa. And they still did.\n\nThey would come.  The vision of Palm Tree confirmed his instincts. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's reflection, and come.  They lacked women; Karolin had plenty.  The same instinct that drew him to Katafa would draw them to Karolin's women.\n\nHe knew danger wasn't just in the north. It lurked wherever greed and hatred resided, not just among savages, but among civilized \"wolves\" as well.\n\nTo Dick, the world was just the water surrounding the two islands.  Yet, even in his short life, he'd learned to fear men, to understand the primal urge for war, violence, and destruction.\n\nThe mirage of Palm Tree faded, vanishing as quickly as it had appeared. Katafa pointed across the lagoon.  A canoe approached from the south \u2013 the one Dick had sent for the canoe builders.  Leaving the coral ledge, they walked towards the beach to meet it.", "reviewed": "## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder\n\nDick stood on a coral ledge, gazing south.
